# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

This application offers a weather dashboard that the user can input a city into in order to get the most up-to-date weather conditions along with the upcoming five day forecast. Whilst no starter code was provided, the point of this particular challenge was to make use of other people's solutions and code to solve a problem we're encountering: namely, access to Third-Party APIs that provide weather data through a series of fetch requests made with specific parameters delineated by myself.

This has been achieved through the deployment of the following coding practices, methods and techniques. Examples as below:

1. Use of the jQuery javaScript library to dynamically create new elements within our HTML, add event listeners onto button elements to handle the user's input when searching for a particular city. 

2. Bootstrap CSS Framework to quickly style and format the page layout for my Weather Dashboard.

3. Two APIs available via OpenWeather were deployed to retrieve the requisite weather data.

4. Setting of the user's input to Local Storage is then implemented to save any past search history, whilst also allowing this information to be displayed within the application for the user even after further searches have been made.
